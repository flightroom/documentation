# Integration overview

So far everything has happened inside Flightroom. This section is about the other side:
how your application actually consumes what you deployed.

## The Integration page

**Integration** in the sidebar generates, for the selected environment, exactly the snippets your
project needs — with your project id and the environment already filled in. The deployment id is not
in any of them: it is a query parameter on the request that generates a snippet, nothing more. The
page has two tabs:

| Tab | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend Integration** | The generated bundler configuration, plus a `curl` example |
| **Environment Variables** | The snippets for reading runtime configuration in the browser |

The page needs the selected environment to have **at least one deployment** — not an active one. The
gate counts deployments, and the page then reads that environment's *last* deployment, the newest by
`deployedAt`, whether or not it happens to be the active one. If the environment has never been
deployed, deploy first: there is nothing to integrate against until then.

Pick a frontend from the selector at the top. It lists every frontend of that deployment,
hosts and remotes alike — nothing is filtered out. What the type changes is only whether the
generated config carries an `exposes` block; the `remotes` block comes from the frontend's
children in the relation graph, so one with no children simply gets none.

### Choosing the stack

Inside the Frontend Integration tab there are two inner tabs, **Module Federation** and **Direct API
Access via CURL** — one per integration model, described below. There are no per-bundler tabs.

The Module Federation tab has two selects instead, both defaulting to **Automatic**:

| Select | Options |
| --- | --- |
| **Framework** | Automatic, React, Vue, Angular |
| **Bundler** | Automatic, Vite, Webpack, Web Component, single-spa, micro-lc |

**Automatic** means the stack stored on the frontend — taken from the template it was created
from, detected in its repository, or set by hand — and a badge above the snippet says which of the
three it was. The selects are overrides, for when detection got it wrong or when you want to read
another stack's instructions. A frontend whose stack is unknown shows no config: a **Stack not
detected** panel takes its place, asking you to pick the framework and the bundler in the selects —
or to connect the repository so the stack can be read from it.

Picking **Web Component** as the bundler produces no configuration at all: web component
frontends are plain scripts registering a custom element, so there is nothing to write into a
bundler config, and the tab shows a runtime-integration note in place of one.

**single-spa** and **micro-lc** are integration models rather than bundlers, so they produce no
Module Federation config either. Instead, the tab shows the file that wires the remotes into the
host, the `configure()` bootstrap for `src/main.tsx`, and how React is shared:

| Stack | Host file | Each remote becomes | React shared through |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| single-spa | `src/applications.ts` | `registerApplication()` whose `app` imports `await remoteUrl(slug)` | the root config's import map |
| micro-lc | `src/microlc-config.ts` | a parcel with `entry: { scripts: [await remoteUrl(slug)] }` | `window.React`, `ReactDOM`, `ReactJSXRuntime` |

A remote of these stacks gets the Vite library build it needs instead: an ES module emitting
`dist/index.js` for single-spa, a UMD script emitting `dist/parcel.js` for micro-lc. In both cases
React stays external. **Integrate my frontends** writes the host file and adds the runtime
packages (`single-spa`, or `@micro-lc/orchestrator`) to `package.json`.

## The two integration models

There are two quite different ways to consume Flightroom, and the right choice depends on
how dynamic you need to be.

### Generated bundler configuration

The console generates the **whole configuration file** — not a `remotes` block to graft onto your
own — and tells you where it belongs, ex. `vite.config.js`. With it come an install line for what
that config needs and a commented-out bootstrap block for your entry point. What gets baked into your
host is not a URL: it is a call into the [client SDK](./client-sdk.md), which asks the serve API for the
URL of each remote at import time.

- Standard Module Federation, plus one `configure()` call in your entry point
- No version, no environment and no CDN path compiled in, so bumping a remote's version — or
  putting it behind a [canary release](../frontends/canary-releases.md) — is just a deployment
- Which remotes the host knows about is still fixed at build time: adding or removing one requires
  a host rebuild

This is what the **Module Federation** tab gives you. Start here.

### Runtime discovery

Your host asks the serve API at boot which remotes exist and where they are, then registers them
dynamically.

- Adding a remote to a host needs no host rebuild — just a deployment
- Requires dynamic remote loading in your host, which Module Federation supports but does not do
  for you
- Costs one HTTP request during startup

This is what the **Direct API Access via CURL** tab is for: a single call to `/serve/all/...` returns
the whole environment — frontends with URLs and versions, plus the environment variables. A
frontend of the **Docker** kind, served by its own Docker container, is left out: no host loads
it as a remote. The tab
shows the `curl` line for the selected environment and, underneath it, a live `<iframe>` preview of
`/api/serve/all/{environmentId}`, so you can read the real response without leaving the page. The
SDK's `manifest()` gives you the same thing without writing the fetch.

Most teams start with the generated configuration and move to runtime discovery when the roster of
remotes starts changing often.

## Writing the integration into your repositories

Rather than copy, paste and commit, you can have Flightroom write the integration into the
repositories itself. Both tabs offer it, and the two are separate integrations that are never
committed together:

| Tab | Button | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend Integration | **Integrate my frontends** | The bundler config of every frontend of the project that consumes others, plus the packages that config needs |
| Frontend Integration | **Integrate only this one** | The same, narrowed to the selected frontend |
| Environment Variables | **Add the script to my hosts** | The `<script>` tag for `window.globalConfig`, into the document of every host |

The buttons are always there: nothing is gated on the selected frontend's repository being
connected. Committing is: it wires together frontends of every domain, so it needs access to the
**whole project**. A member limited to specific domains can open the dialog and read the plan, but
not commit it. What each one opens is a dialog that first computes a plan **for the whole project** —
because the remotes of one frontend are the other frontends of it — with narrowing deciding
only what is shown and what can be committed.

The dialog then lists one row per repository with a status (*already integrated*, *config to create*,
*config to replace*, *no remotes to declare*, *stack unknown*, *integrates at runtime*, *no document
to write into*, *error*) and a diff you can expand to compare what is in the repository against what
would be written. You tick the repositories to commit to, and the write lands on the **default
branch** of each one. Rows the plan cannot act on cannot be ticked.

## What the platform serves

Whatever integration model you choose, these are the things your application can ask for, from the
resolved environment's deployment — the **active** one for everything except the file endpoints, which
[which deployment answers](./serve-api.md#which-deployment-answers) sets out:

| Ask | Endpoint family |
| --- | --- |
| Everything about this environment | `/serve/all/...` |
| Just the runtime variables | `/serve/global-variables/...` |
| One frontend's URL and version | `/serve/mfe/config/...` |
| A frontend's actual files | `/serve/mfe/files/...` |

These endpoints are **public and unauthenticated** — they are meant to be called from browsers.
The complete reference is in [Serve API](./serve-api.md).

Each family can be addressed either with the environment named in the path, or through an `auto`
form that carries only the project id and lets the platform resolve the environment from the
request's domain. The second is what makes one host build usable in every stage, and what the SDK
falls back to when `configure()` is called without an `environment` — at the cost of depending on
the [allowed domains](../environments/domains.md) being right.

## Where to go next

- [Client SDK](./client-sdk.md) — `@mfe-orchestrator-hub/client`, which the generated configuration
  delegates remote resolution to
- [Vite](./module-federation-vite.md) — `@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`
- [Webpack](./module-federation-webpack.md) — `ModuleFederationPlugin`
- [Runtime configuration](./runtime-configuration.md) — reading environment variables in the browser
- [Serve API](./serve-api.md) — the full public endpoint reference
