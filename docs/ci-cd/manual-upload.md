# Upload a build from any CI system

Everything the provider-specific pipelines do reduces to one HTTP call. This page documents it, so
you can publish from any CI system — or from your laptop when debugging.

## The endpoint

```http
POST <API_BASE>/frontends/by-slug/{frontendSlug}/upload/{version}
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | `api-key` header (see [API keys](./api-keys.md)) |
| **Body** | `multipart/form-data` with a single ZIP file |
| **Project** | Derived from the API key — no `project-id` header needed |

## Minimal example

```bash
cd dist
zip -r ../dist.zip .
cd ..

curl -X POST \
  -H "api-key: $MFE_ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@dist.zip" \
  "https://console.flightroom.dev/api/frontends/by-slug/catalog/upload/1.4.0"
```

## Zipping correctly

This is where most first attempts go wrong. The archive must contain the **contents** of your build
output, not the folder itself:

```
✅ dist.zip
   ├── index.html
   └── assets/
       └── remoteEntry.js

❌ dist.zip
   └── dist/
       ├── index.html
       └── assets/
           └── remoteEntry.js
```

The second produces an entry point at `dist/assets/remoteEntry.js`, which does not match the
configured entry point, and every request 404s.

```bash
# ✅ zip from inside the output directory
cd dist && zip -r ../dist.zip . && cd ..

# ❌ zips the directory itself
zip -r dist.zip dist
```

Verify before uploading:

```bash
unzip -l dist.zip | head
```

The first entries should be your files, not a directory prefix.

## Requirements and behaviour

- The file must be a **ZIP**: it is accepted when its MIME type is `application/zip` **or** its
  file name ends in `.zip`, and rejected only when neither holds.
- The frontend must already exist in the project, matched by **slug**.
- The archive is extracted into the version's folder, wherever that frontend is
  [hosted](../frontends/hosting-options.md) — the platform's own storage or your bucket.
- Uploading a version that already exists overwrites its files in place. The target folder is not
  cleaned first, so a file that was in the previous upload and is absent from the new one survives
  under the same version and is still served.
- **Custom URL** frontends cannot be uploaded to; the request fails. Publishing is entirely
  yours in that case.
- Frontends served by **their own Docker container** cannot be uploaded to either: the request
  fails with `DOCKER_FRONTEND_UPLOAD_NOT_ALLOWED`. Their pipeline registers the version of the pushed image
  instead — see [what a key can call](./api-keys.md#what-a-key-can-call).

:::caution[Overwriting a deployed version]
Re-uploading a version that some environment is currently serving changes what those users get,
without any deployment. Publish a new version instead — versions are cheap, and it keeps rollback
meaningful.
:::

## Publishing does not deploy

After a successful upload the version exists and is selectable, but nothing changes for your users.
Select the version on the frontend and [deploy](../deployments/overview.md) the environment.

:::caution[An API key cannot deploy]
`POST /api/deployment` — the endpoint behind the **Deploy** button, which takes
`{ "environmentIds": ["…"] }` — is authenticated with the token of a signed-in user. An API key
authenticates the upload endpoint and nothing else, so a pipeline holding one can publish a version
but cannot make it live. Automating the deployment of a development environment means driving that
call with a user token of your own, obtained outside the CI key mechanism.
:::

For production the manual step is the point: the separation between *published* and *live* is the
platform's main safety property.

## A generic pipeline step

For a CI system with no dedicated integration:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

: "${MFE_ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY:?missing API key}"
: "${VERSION:?missing version}"

SLUG="catalog"
API_BASE="https://console.flightroom.dev/api"

npm ci
npm run build

( cd dist && zip -qr ../dist.zip . )

curl --fail --show-error --silent \
  -X POST \
  -H "api-key: ${MFE_ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY}" \
  -F "file=@dist.zip" \
  "${API_BASE}/frontends/by-slug/${SLUG}/upload/${VERSION}"

echo "published ${SLUG} ${VERSION}"
```

`--fail` matters: without it `curl` exits 0 on an HTTP error and your pipeline reports a green build
that published nothing.

Deriving `VERSION` from the Git tag keeps the version and the source in step:

```bash
VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME}"      # GitHub Actions
VERSION="${CI_COMMIT_TAG}"        # GitLab CI
VERSION="${BUILD_SOURCEBRANCHNAME}"  # Azure DevOps
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `401` / authentication error | Missing, wrong, revoked or **expired** `api-key` |
| `File must be a ZIP archive` | Wrong MIME type or extension — send a real `.zip` |
| Entity not found for the slug | No frontend with that slug in the key's project |
| `Frontend host type is not supported` | The frontend is **Custom URL** |
| Upload succeeds, app 404s | Entry point mismatch, or the ZIP has a directory prefix |
| Upload succeeds, users see the old version | You have not deployed |

For the entry point: Vite Module Federation emits `assets/remoteEntry.js`, Webpack emits
`remoteEntry.js`. The **Entry Point** field on the frontend must match what your build actually
produces.
